# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using regression techniques in Machine Learning. The goal is to build a model that can estimate house prices based on various features such as size, number of rooms, location factors, etc.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. Data Loading
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Training (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso)
6. Model Evaluation
7. Conclusion

## 📊 Model Performance

**Linear Regression**  
- R² Score: 0.9638  
- Mean Squared Error: 161,173,486,211  

**Ridge Regression**  
- R² Score: 0.9630  
- Mean Squared Error: 164,432,730,242  

**Lasso Regression**  
- R² Score: 0.9638  
- Mean Squared Error: 161,173,792,847  

### 🔎 Analysis
All three models performed similarly with an R² score of approximately 0.96.  
Since the dataset is synthetic and strongly linear, regularization did not significantly change performance.

## 🎯 Goal
To understand regression models deeply and apply them to real-world datasets.
