# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using regression techniques in Machine Learning. The goal is to build a model that can estimate house prices based on various features such as size, number of rooms, location factors, etc.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. Data Loading
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Training (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso)
6. Model Evaluation
7. Conclusion

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 161,173,486,211  
- **R² Score:** 0.9637  

The model explains approximately 96% of the variance in house prices, indicating a strong linear relationship between size, number of bedrooms, and price.

## 🎯 Goal
To understand regression models deeply and apply them to real-world datasets.
